      <description>Magazino The Magazino GmbH is a robotics startup based in Munich, Germany. The products of the company are autonomous logistics robots that get deployed in the warehouses of the customer to reduce the workload for the employees during times with a high amount of orders (Christmas for example) or during times when the employees are on vacation or a high rate of sickness related drop outs is to be expected. The robots, once configured, can be dropped into the warehouse.</description>

      <description>The Project Description The Magazino robots (TORU, SOTO) can generate a map using two dimensional LIDAR. With this map, a robot can localize itself and find paths from one to another location. However, for the autonomous operation of the robot, it needs more information. This semantic data (like compartment names, locked off areas and similar) can not easily be generated by the robot and therefore has to be modeled and stored in a configuration file.</description>

      <description>Description For the European DataBio project, our team of three wanted to create a tool that displayed some historic data. The general idea of the DataBio project was to increase the efficient use of agriculture, forestry, and fishery/aquaculture chains.
Contribution The tool had two basic parts: data accumulation from the semantic web and the data representation. I was mostly responsible for the representation layer using Pythons Bokeh library.</description>
