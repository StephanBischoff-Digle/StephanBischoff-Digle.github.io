      <description>Description The Magazino robots (TORU, SOTO) had to communicate errors somehow; especially during performance evaluations. For this purpose the robot had LEDs in front and in the back, such that errors could be signaled visually from afar. Additionally, operators connected to the robot via ssh were able to collect more detailed information over a tmux session dedicated to logging the robots state.
This kind of informationis useful as soon as it is generated and to more than just the person connected to the machine (which might be zero).</description>

      <description>Description The Magazino robots (TORU, SOTO) can generate a map using two dimensional LIDAR. With this map, a robot can localize itself and find paths from one to another location. However, for the autonomous operation of the robot, it needs more information. This semantic data (like compartment names, locked off areas and similar) can not easily be generated by the robot and therefore has to be modeled and stored in a configuration file.</description>

      <description>Description For the european DataBio project, our team of three wanted to create a tool that displayed some historic data. The general idea of the DataBio project was to increase the efficient use of agriculture, forestry, and fishery/aquaculture chains.
Contribution The tool had two basic parts: data accumulation from the semantic web and the data representaiton. I was mostly responsible for the representation layer using Pythons Bokeh library.</description>
