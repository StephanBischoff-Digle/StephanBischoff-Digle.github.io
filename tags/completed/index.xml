      <description>Description The Nao Team of the HTWK is a major participant in the Robocup Standard Platform League. With a team of 6 humanoid robots we play soccer against a different team with the same type of robots. The SPL is a contest of software that uses the given hardware (the standard platform) in the best way to score goals.
Part of the competition rules is the so called &amp;ldquo;pushing&amp;rdquo; rule. It punishes the robot that caused the fall down of a competing robot in a situation when the ball is not directly involved.</description>
