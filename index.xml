      <description>General Idea  Minimize uncertainty of the location of vision related objects on the playing field  Static objects such as field markings and the goal Dynamic objects such as the ball and other robots.   Based on probabilistic distributions from the detectors and predictors Weighted on game state  Ball is not important after a goal is scored Could be modeled via weight profiles    Probability Distribution  Represented as a grid or quad tree â€¦ or something in between Grid can easily be filled with partial data and normalized to any value Quad tree is more based on areas Distributions can be layered with a game-state factor  Solver  naive approach would be a search for maxima&amp;rsquo;s while updating the distribution, such that the current view is always in the global minimum.</description>

      <description>Magazino The Magazino GmbH is a robotics startup based in Munich, Germany. The products of the company are autonomous logistics robots that get deployed in the warehouses of the customer to reduce the workload for the employees during times with a high amount of orders (Christmas for example) or during times when the employees are on vacation or a high rate of sickness related drop outs is to be expected. The robots, once configured, can be dropped into the warehouse.</description>

      <description>The Project Description The Magazino robots (TORU, SOTO) can generate a map using two dimensional LIDAR. With this map, a robot can localize itself and find paths from one to another location. However, for the autonomous operation of the robot, it needs more information. This semantic data (like compartment names, locked off areas and similar) can not easily be generated by the robot and therefore has to be modeled and stored in a configuration file.</description>

      <description>Description The Nao Team of the HTWK is a major participant in the Robocup Standard Platform League. With a team of 6 humanoid robots we play soccer against a different team with the same type of robots. The SPL is a contest of software that uses the given hardware (the standard platform) in the best way to score goals.
Part of the competition rules is the so called &amp;ldquo;pushing&amp;rdquo; rule. It punishes the robot that caused the fall down of a competing robot in a situation when the ball is not directly involved.</description>

      <description>Description For the European DataBio project, our team of three wanted to create a tool that displayed some historic data. The general idea of the DataBio project was to increase the efficient use of agriculture, forestry, and fishery/aquaculture chains.
Contribution The tool had two basic parts: data accumulation from the semantic web and the data representation. I was mostly responsible for the representation layer using Pythons Bokeh library.</description>
