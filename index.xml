      <description>Description The Nao Team of the HTWK is a major participant in the Robocups Standard Platform League. With a team of 6 humanoid robots we play soccer against a different team with the same type of robots. The SPL is a contest of software that uses the given hardware (the standard platform) in the best way to score goals.
Part of the competition rules is the so called &amp;ldquo;pushing&amp;rdquo; rule. It punishes the robot that caused the falldown of a competing robot in a situation when the ball is not directly involved.</description>

      <description>Description For the european DataBio project, our team of three wanted to create a tool that displayed some historic data. The general idea of the DataBio project was to increase the efficient use of agriculture, forestry, and fishery/aquaculture chains.
Contribution The tool had two basic parts: data accumulation from the semantic web and the data representaiton. I was mostly responsible for the representation layer using Pythons Bokeh library.</description>
